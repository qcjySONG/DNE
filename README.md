## 📖 Introduction
✨ Infectious disease outbreaks have the potential to result in substantial human casualties and financial losses. Issuing timely warnings and taking appropriate measures before infectious disease outbreaks can effectively hinder or even prevent the spread of epidemics. However, the spread of infectious diseases is a complex and dynamic process that involves both biological and social systems. Consequently, issuing accurate early warnings for infectious disease outbreaks in real-time remains a significant challenge. In this study, we have developed a **novel** computational approach called dynamic network entropy (**DNE**) by constructing **city networks** and leveraging extensive **hospital visit record data** to pinpoint early warning signals for infectious disease outbreaks. Specifically, the proposed method can accurately identify pre-outbreak of infectious diseases including influenza and hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). The predicted early warning signals preceded the outbreaks or initial peaks by at least 6 weeks for influenza and 5 weeks for HFMD. Additionally, compared to other existing methods, our proposed approach exhibits good performance in pinpointing critical warning signals. Therefore, by harnessing detailed dynamic and high-dimensional information, our DNE method presents an innovative strategy for identifying the critical point or pre-outbreaks stage prior to the catastrophic transition into a pandemic outbreak, which holds significant potential for application in the field of public health surveillance.

### 📬 Reviewer Highlights

> 💬 *"Overall, I find that the methodology presented by the authors represents a good addition to the field of mathematical epidemiology and complements other existing methods, improving our preparedness against epidemic outbreaks. The findings and the method here proposed are relevant for the physics and biology communities, thus making this contribution interesting for the Journal of Royal Society Interface readership."*

> 💬 *"In the revised version of the manuscript, the authors have satisfactorily addressed all my concerns. The new analyses included in the manuscript—breaking down the different contributions to the DNE score and comparing DNE with other benchmarks—are really helpful to understand the shortcomings and advantages of the proposed methodology."*

> 💬 *"Given the interdisciplinary interest of data-driven approaches to provide early-warning signals of the epidemic outbreak, I endorse the publication of the manuscript in Journal of the Royal Society Interface."* ✨

---

> 💬 *"This article is now clearer on the underlying framework, approach, and outputs, allowing readers to critically assess the work and its applicability, which was my main concern."*

> 💬 *"The paper continues to make some assumptions regarding the nature of spread (e.g., modeled as a continuous function with stable geographic boundaries), and I wonder whether pairing the approach with network models based on activity rather than geography (e.g., anchoring heavy nodes and counteracting them to avoid over-weighting) might be useful in future work. Best of luck with it!"* 🌈

这篇工作其实只做了3个月，但是投稿投了整整一年，从24年的7月中旬一直到25年的7月1号才收到了录用。期间，有的期刊是一审后拒绝的，有的是直接桌拒的，并且这个领域的审稿人审稿时间都出奇的久（例如，这个期刊其实只返修了一次但是都搞了7个月）。由于时差问题，拒稿信一般在深夜收到，其实有时候有点伤心，也磨灭了那一点点的自命不凡对学术的高追求。
写这篇论文的时候也是我本科的最后一段时间了，我记得那时候的毕业论文致谢写的嚣张跋扈不知所谓。我忠心的感谢数学和食品两个学院的小伙伴，非常怀念当时一起玩、一起烦恼代码怎么写的时光；其次，也要感谢江湾图书馆4楼哪些不知道名字也没有任何交谈的同学，那段眉头紧皱的时光虽然不怀念但确实是过得最纯粹的一段时光了。再者，我要感谢姜老师、许老师和这篇论文的通讯钟老师，他们分别覆盖帮助了我本科的3个不同阶段。最后，我要感谢广东工业大学选择了我，感谢DMIR实验室收留了我，并且一直尽可能给我所有需要的研究资源。
